## Running web scrapers

All the [Scrapy](https://docs.scrapy.org/) spiders are in the `scraping` directory.

You can run a specific spider by supplying the name and output file:

```shell
poetry run scrapy crawl dopomoga -o data/dopomoga.csv
```

## Creating new spiders

You can place your new spiders into `scraping/spiders` directory and implement according 
to the [Scrapy tutorial](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html).

It's highly recommended to add unit tests for your spider's `parse` method.

## Using VS Code

VS Code does not immediately recognize the virtual environment location

to make it work (and so imports are properly recognized)

click Run => add configuration  and select Python from the list

this will add a configuration launch.json

you will need to add one line to this configuration

```
"env": {"PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceRoot}"}
```

it should look something like this

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "env": {"PYTHONPATH": "${workspaceRoot}"},
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "justMyCode": true
        }
    ]
}
```
